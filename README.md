A simple program for managing my home's inventory. It uses web UI via Flask.  
Justification: I want to know in which containers (boxes, shelves, etc.) I store my items and my memory is not good enough.

Demo of current state (WiP ofc):

![demo](./documentation/images/demo-opt.gif)

Containers directory is not included(gitignore) in this project for privacy  
Example structure:
